## Mandelbrot fractal in Emacs LISP

I'm curious to know how the Mandelbrot set would look in a text window, possibly with some cleverness in the representation (cfr the Wikipedia page for "Mandelbrot set" where the first Mandelbrot set image, as a 80x25 text image, is presented).

Also, I'm itching to carefree write some LISP code, without expectations of big projects involved.
