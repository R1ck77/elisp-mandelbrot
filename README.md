## Mandelbrot fractal in Emacs LISP

I'm curious to know how the Mandelbrot set would look in a text window, possibly with some cleverness in the representation (cfr the Wikipedia page for "Mandelbrot set" where the first Mandelbrot set image, as a 80x25 text image, is presented).

Also, I'm itching to write some LISP code carefree, without expectations or any big projects involved.

### Status

If you load and evaluate `mandelbrot.el` and then execute

    M-x mandelbrot-mode
    
you'll probably get something like this: 

![Mandelbrot, second  draft](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R1ck77/elisp-mandelbrot/master/images/mehndelbrot.png)

but your mileage will vary, depending on the fonts and terminal used.

The terminal version of Emacs does a pretty decent job, where the windowed one looks awful-er due to characters spacing.

The major mode has a number of simple commands to zoom on a region (C-space to mark the start of the region, then z), change the maximum number of iterations (i), redraw (r) or reset to the initial region (R).

### Limitations

It's a Mandelbrot program that uses ELISP for computations and draws the result in a text windows, how many more limitations do you want? xD

The code doesn't employ any neat trick (like symmetry exploitation) to make the calculations faster.

### TODO

I'd like to toy with dynamic modules and provide a C-like quick mandelbrot alternative. Also, I'd like to explore different levels of integration with C, from the lowest level (which I expect to provide no benefit) to the highest:

- C for Complex addition and multiplication only
- C for mandelbrot computations
- C for trajectory computation

where I expect the first solution to be slower, the second to be around the break-even point and the third to be faster.

I'd like to mark the region the user is zooming in with color, also the zoom command is a bit bugged, as it allows to flip the graph (tolerated atm, but not intentionalâ€¦).

Showing the current maximum number of iterations during query and offering the current value as default may also be nice.
